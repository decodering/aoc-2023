## How to run this repository

A [makefile is attached](https://calmcode.io/makefiles/the-problem.html) for the simple running of the challenges. An example of how to run one of the makefile commands:

```bash
make day6
```

Sometimes some of these challenges have an alternative run for sample inputs, i.e. a kind of test to see if the expected answer is printed. This command is suffixed (perhaps not v accurately) with `-test`.

```bash
make day6-test
```

That's it! Finally:

```ascii
